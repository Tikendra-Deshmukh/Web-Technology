    <h1 align="center">New Delhi</h1>

    <p><b>New Delhi</b>, the capital and the third largest city of India, is a fusion of the ancient and the modern. The remains of Muslim Dynasties with their architectural delights give the majestic ambiance of the bygone era.</p>

    <p>On the other side, New Delhi, the imperial city built by the British, reflects the fast-paced present. The most fascinating of all is the character of Delhi, which varies from the 13th-century mausoleum of the Lodi kings to ultra-modern glass skyscrapers.</p>
